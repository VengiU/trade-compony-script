All enterprises sooner or later face the need to develop a database for their own needs. The main segments in trade enterprises are for the most part not unique. Accordingly, the basis for any trading enterprise can serve as a simple database of goods, their sale, supplies, traffic, employees, their movements, and also buyers and suppliers. All the basic data must be relation and not contradict each other. So when selling goods, the balance in the warehouse should decrease. Such simple rules and relationships are implemented in a database version for a simple trading company. (See schema)
Also, triggers are implemented to normalize the addition of data on sales, movements and supplies of goods, and also for employees.
The script adds 2 functions that are very useful on the versions of MS SQL Server below 2016 for translating a string data array with delimiters into a table view.
To speed up the processing of queries to the database by basic procedures, indexes on tables are additionally implemented.
And 3 procedures are added that return the simplest data on the enterprise, such as the turnover of goods, the profitability of the firm or individual stores, and also - sales by employees.
