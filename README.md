All enterprises sooner or later face the need to develop a database for their own needs. The main segments in trade enterprises are for the most part not unique. Accordingly, the basis for any trading enterprise can serve as a simple database of goods, their sale, supplies, traffic, employees, their movements, and also buyers and suppliers. All the basic data must be relation and not contradict each other. So when selling goods, the balance in the warehouse should decrease. Such simple rules and relationships are implemented in a database version for a simple trading company.
